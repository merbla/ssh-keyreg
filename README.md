ssh-keyreg is command-line method or programmatically add ssh key to github.com user account.

## Description

>Is there a way to identify with a username and password to github.com servers for the purpose of adding an ssh key to the github user account? So far everything I've read suggests that a user's ssh key must be added via the web GUI. I'm looking for the method or process of adding a key via a command line interface or else a bash/ansible/something script.
